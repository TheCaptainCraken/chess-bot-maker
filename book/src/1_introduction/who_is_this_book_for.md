# Who is this book for

Hello again, in this section I'll cover a few things I'll take from granted from now on. In case you're new to any of these or you need a quick refresher, I'll leave links to some solid free resources on the internet.

First up, you should be a decent programmer: this means concepts like linked lists, vectors or hashmaps should sound familiar to you. If they don't I recommend watching [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), it's an excellent resource to learn programming.

Since the examples in the book (and the starter code) are written in Rust, you should be familiar with its syntax. No need to be an expert but you should be comfortable with everything in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). If you don't know what Rust is, go there and take a look, it's a modern alternative to C++ that eliminates a lot of memory management related bugs. I'll promise it's worth learning. Also you can take a look at [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/).

Last but not least, you should know how to play chess. But since you're here I guess you already do.
