# Contributing

I started this project to help other people find joy in chess programming. If you want to help me you are very welcome!

Please report any mistakes that you find in the book or example code by either opening an issue on [GitHub](www.github.com/thecaptaincraken/chess-bot-maker) sending an email to <thecaptaincraken@gmail.com>.

Any feature request or suggestion is welcome and if you're an experienced developer you can help the project by submitting a PR!

Together we can make anything possible.
