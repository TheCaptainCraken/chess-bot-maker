# MVP

## Audience

This product is designed for individuals who are both coding enthusiasts and chess lovers, primarily targeting first-year computer science students and highly skilled high school students. The typical age range is 18 to 25. These users will have a foundational understanding of at least one programming language and some familiarity with basic algorithms and data structures.

## Problem

Creating a chess bot can be an immensely rewarding yet challenging learning experience. Many aspiring developers struggle due to the complexity and time investment required, often facing the need to build multiple components from scratch. While there are resources available, they tend to be limited and lack clarity, leading to frustration and abandonment of projects. There is a clear demand for a resource that enables users to quickly develop a functional project they can showcase to friends and family.

## The Actual MVP

Our product will consist of two main components: an online book and a GitHub repository. 

1. **Online Book**: This resource will guide users through the fundamentals of searching and evaluating positions for a chess engine. It will begin with the basics of the minimax algorithm for searching and simple material evaluation methods.

2. **GitHub Repository**: This will include:
   - A fully functional chess bot built in Go, which users can modify based on the concepts learned in the book.
   - A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to play against their newly created bot.

This structured approach will provide users with the tools and knowledge needed to quickly build and showcase their own chess bot, making the learning process engaging and rewarding.
